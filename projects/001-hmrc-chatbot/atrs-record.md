## Section 2: Description and Rationale

### 2.1 - Detailed Description

**Technical Architecture**:

The HMRC ChatBot is a generative AI system that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate tax guidance grounded in official HMRC publications and UK tax legislation.

**High-Level Architecture**:
```
[Citizen Query]
  ↓
[GOV.UK ChatBot Interface] (React + GOV.UK Design System)
  ↓
[API Gateway] (AWS API Gateway - authentication, rate limiting)
  ↓
[Conversational AI Service] (ECS Fargate - Python/LangChain)
  ├─ [1. Input Validation] (prompt injection detection, content filters)
  ├─ [2. Query Embedding] (AWS Titan Embeddings)
  ├─ [3. RAG Retrieval] (OpenSearch k-NN - top 5 relevant HMRC documents)
  ├─ [4. Context Augmentation] (construct prompt with retrieved documents)
  ├─ [5. LLM Generation] (AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
  ├─ [6. Guardrails] (validate response, check for hallucinations, PII exposure)
  ├─ [7. Source Citation] (extract references to HMRC guidance)
  └─ [8. Response to Citizen] (with source links, confidence score)
  ↓
[Audit Logging] (all queries, responses, sources logged to RDS PostgreSQL)
```

**Data Flow**:
1. Citizen enters tax question (e.g., "What expenses can I claim as self-employed?")
2. Query embedded as 1536-dimensional vector
3. Vector search retrieves top-5 most relevant HMRC guidance documents from knowledge base
4. Retrieved documents injected into LLM prompt as context
5. Claude 3.5 Sonnet generates response grounded in retrieved documents
6. Response validated (factual consistency, guardrails, source citation)
7. Response displayed to citizen with clickable source links to GOV.UK
8. Full conversation logged for audit and quality assurance

**Algorithm Type**:
[X] Generative AI (LLM/Foundation Model)
[X] Natural Language Processing
[X] Hybrid approach (RAG = retrieval + generation)

**AI Model Details**:
- **Model Name/Type**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
- **Model Provider**: Anthropic PBC (accessed via AWS Bedrock)
- **Model Version**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (as of October 2024; version may update)
- **Model Size**: ~200B parameters (estimated; Anthropic does not disclose exact size)
- **Context Window**: 200,000 tokens input, 8,192 tokens output
- **Fine-tuned**: [X] No - uses pre-trained Claude 3.5 Sonnet (no fine-tuning on HMRC data)
- **Training Data**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet trained by Anthropic on diverse internet text, books, academic papers (cutoff date: April 2024). HMRC has no access to or control over Anthropic training data.

**Prompting Strategy**:
- **System Prompt**: Instructs Claude to act as an HMRC tax guidance assistant, using only retrieved HMRC documents, citing sources, declining to provide tax calculations or advice on avoidance
- **Few-Shot Examples**: 5-10 example Q&A pairs demonstrating desired response style (Plain English, source citations)
- **Retrieved Context**: Top-5 HMRC guidance documents (up to 10,000 tokens)
- **User Query**: Citizen's question (up to 500 tokens)

**Technical Components**:
1. **Frontend**: React 18 with GOV.UK Design System components, hosted on AWS CloudFront + S3
2. **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway (REST + WebSocket for real-time chat)
3. **Authentication**: AWS Cognito integrated with Government Gateway OAuth 2.0
4. **Conversational AI Service**: Python 3.11, LangChain, deployed on AWS ECS Fargate
5. **Vector Database**: Amazon OpenSearch with k-NN plugin (100,000 HMRC guidance documents)
6. **Embedding Model**: AWS Titan Embeddings (1536-dimensional vectors)
7. **LLM**: AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet API
8. **Knowledge Base Storage**: Amazon S3 (HMRC guidance PDFs, Markdown)
9. **Relational Database**: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL 15 (citizen profiles, conversations, audit logs)
10. **Cache**: Amazon ElastiCache Redis (session management, frequent query caching)
11. **Monitoring**: Amazon CloudWatch (logs, metrics, traces), AWS X-Ray (distributed tracing)
12. **Security**: AWS WAF (OWASP Top 10 protection), AWS Shield Advanced (DDoS), AWS Secrets Manager

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
RAG is used to ground AI responses in authoritative HMRC sources, preventing hallucinations (AI making up incorrect tax guidance).

**Why RAG?**
- **Accuracy**: LLMs can hallucinate (invent facts). RAG ensures responses based on real HMRC guidance.
- **Explainability**: Every response cites specific HMRC documents, enabling citizens to verify guidance.
- **Auditability**: Source citations create audit trail from query → retrieved docs → response.
- **Updateability**: When tax law changes, HMRC updates knowledge base documents; RAG immediately reflects latest guidance without retraining LLM.

**Knowledge Base**:
- **Size**: 100,000 HMRC guidance documents (Self Assessment, PAYE, VAT, National Insurance, Capital Gains, Inheritance Tax)
- **Sources**: HMRC public guidance on GOV.UK, UK tax legislation (Finance Acts), HMRC manuals
- **Languages**: English and Welsh (Welsh Language Act 1993 requirement)
- **Format**: Chunked into 1000-token segments, embedded as 1536-dimensional vectors
- **Update Frequency**: Daily automated ingestion from HMRC content management system; real-time for urgent policy changes (e.g., Budget announcements)

### 2.2 - Scope

**Intended Use**:

The HMRC ChatBot is designed to provide **general tax guidance** to UK citizens on common tax questions, including:
- Self Assessment (income tax for self-employed, freelancers)
- PAYE (employment income tax, tax codes)
- VAT (Value Added Tax for businesses)
- National Insurance contributions
- Capital Gains Tax
- Inheritance Tax
- Tax deadlines and filing requirements
- Tax allowances and reliefs
- What expenses can be claimed
- How to register for taxes

**Use Cases**:
1. **Unauthenticated Citizens**: Get general guidance (e.g., "What is Self Assessment?")
2. **Authenticated Citizens** (via Government Gateway): Get personalized guidance based on tax records (e.g., "What is my tax code?")
3. **Welsh Speakers**: Access guidance in Welsh language
4. **Disabled Citizens**: Use ChatBot with assistive technologies (screen readers, keyboard-only navigation)

**Out of Scope** (ChatBot will NOT):
- Calculate exact tax liability (e.g., "How much tax will I owe on £50,000 income?") - requires human tax advisor
- Provide advice on tax avoidance or evasion schemes - illegal and blocked by guardrails
- Handle tax filing or payments - these remain in existing HMRC online services
- Make decisions about tax appeals or disputes - escalated to human agents
- Provide legal or financial advice - directs citizens to qualified advisors
- Handle fraud investigations - separate HMRC systems
- Process personal data without consent - UK GDPR rights respected

**User Population**:
- **External Users (Citizens)**: 50 million UK taxpayers (potential audience)
  - **Year 1 Target**: 5 million conversations (10% of current helpline calls)
  - **Year 3 Target**: 15 million conversations (30% helpline deflection)
- **Internal Users (HMRC Staff)**: 500 HMRC helpline agents (reviewing escalated queries from ChatBot)

**Geographic Scope**: UK-wide (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland)

**Language Support**: English and Welsh (legal requirement under Welsh Language Act 1993)

### 2.3 - Benefit

**Intended Benefits**:

**For Citizens**:
1. **24/7 Availability**: Get tax guidance instantly, any time (current helplines operate 08:00-20:00 Mon-Fri only)
2. **Reduced Wait Times**: Instant responses vs. 20+ minute helpline waits during peak (January Self Assessment deadline)
3. **Accessible Service**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliant (screen readers, keyboard navigation, Plain English, Welsh language)
4. **Explainable Guidance**: Every AI response cites official HMRC sources with clickable links to GOV.UK for verification
5. **Consistency**: Same accurate guidance for all citizens (vs. variability in human helpline quality)

**For HMRC**:
1. **Cost Savings**: £75M annual savings by Year 3 (30% helpline deflection × £5 average call cost)
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Free up human agents for complex queries requiring judgment
3. **Scalability**: Handle demand spikes (January deadline) without proportional staffing increases
4. **Data Insights**: Analyze common citizen questions to improve guidance and policy

**Evidence of Benefits**:
- **User Research** (Discovery phase, completed 2025-10): 85% of citizens support 24/7 self-service for simple tax queries
- **Private Beta Target** (2026-05): 100 citizens test ChatBot; target >70% satisfaction
- **Public Beta Target** (2026-07): 10,000 citizens; validate 10% helpline deflection
- **Benchmarks**: Similar government chatbots (GOV.UK Ask, DWP Universal Credit) achieve 20-40% deflection rates

### 2.4 - Previous Process

**Before Implementation**:

Citizens seeking tax guidance had three options:
1. **Phone Helpline** (50M calls/year):
   - **Hours**: 08:00-20:00 Monday-Friday (closed weekends, bank holidays)
   - **Wait Time**: Average 10 minutes (peak January: 20+ minutes)
   - **Cost**: £5-£10 per call (staff time, telephony)
   - **Quality**: Variable (depends on agent knowledge, training)
2. **GOV.UK Website** (self-service):
   - **Content**: Static guidance pages, PDFs
   - **Search**: Keyword search (not conversational, difficult to find relevant guidance)
   - **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliant but text-heavy, jargon-laden
3. **HMRC Post** (written queries):
   - **Response Time**: 15 working days average
   - **Volume**: 2M letters/year

**Comparison**:
| Aspect | Previous Process (Phone Helpline) | Current Tool (ChatBot) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Availability** | 08:00-20:00 Mon-Fri (60 hours/week) | 24/7/365 (168 hours/week) |
| **Wait Time** | 10-20 minutes (peak) | <2 seconds (instant) |
| **Cost per Query** | £5-£10 (phone call) | <£0.50 (ChatBot conversation) |
| **Accuracy** | Variable (human error ~5%) | >95% (AI grounded in HMRC guidance) |
| **User Experience** | Phone anxiety, long waits, business-hours only | Instant, text-based, any time |
| **Fairness** | Consistent (same guidance for all) | Consistent + bias tested across demographics |
| **Explainability** | Verbal advice (no source citations) | Every response cites HMRC sources with links |
| **Accessibility** | Phone-only (barriers for deaf, hard-of-hearing) | Text + screen reader + Welsh language |
| **Scalability** | Linear (more calls = more staff) | Elastic (scales to handle millions of conversations) |

**Why Change Was Needed**:
- **Unsustainable Costs**: 50M calls/year × £5-10/call = £250-500M annual operating cost
- **Poor Citizen Experience**: Long wait times, business-hours only, phone anxiety
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Phone-only service excludes deaf, hard-of-hearing citizens
- **Scalability Limits**: Cannot hire proportionally more staff to handle demand spikes

### 2.5 - Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1**: Enhanced GOV.UK Search (Keyword-based)
- **Description**: Improve GOV.UK website search with better keyword matching, filters
- **Benefits**: Low cost, no AI risk, builds on existing infrastructure
- **Reason for Rejection**: Keyword search requires citizens to know exact terms (e.g., "Self Assessment" vs. "freelance tax"). User research showed 60% of citizens struggle to find relevant guidance via keyword search. Does not provide conversational, contextual answers.

**Alternative 2**: Human Chatbot (Rule-based Decision Tree)
- **Description**: Scripted chatbot using decision trees (if/then rules) designed by HMRC tax policy experts
- **Benefits**: Explainable, controllable, no AI hallucination risk
- **Reason for Rejection**: Decision trees cannot handle ~1M possible tax scenarios (combinatorial explosion). Requires manual scripting for every question variant. Rigid, cannot understand natural language variations (e.g., "What can I claim?" vs. "Allowable expenses?"). User research: 75% of citizens found rule-based chatbots frustrating ("doesn't understand my question").

**Alternative 3**: Offshore Helpline (Human Agents in Lower-Cost Region)
- **Description**: Outsource helpline to offshore call center (e.g., India, Philippines) to reduce cost
- **Benefits**: Lower cost per call (£2-3 vs. £5-10)
- **Reason for Rejection**:
  - **Data Sovereignty**: UK GDPR prohibits transferring citizen tax data to non-UK jurisdictions without adequate safeguards
  - **Security Risk**: Offshore agents handling OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data (National Insurance numbers, income) creates data breach risk
  - **Quality Concerns**: Offshore agents less familiar with UK tax law, accent/language barriers
  - **Public Trust**: Citizens prefer UK-based support for sensitive tax matters

**Alternative 4**: No Change (Status Quo)
- **Description**: Continue current helpline model, no digital self-service
- **Benefits**: No implementation risk, no AI concerns, familiar to staff
- **Reason for Rejection**:
  - **Unsustainable Costs**: £250-500M/year operating costs, rising with inflation
  - **Poor User Experience**: Long wait times, business-hours only
  - **Fails GDS Service Standard**: Government must provide digital-first services
  - **Missed Savings**: No cost reduction, no efficiency gains

**Non-Algorithmic Approach**:
Pure human helpline (Alternative 4) considered but rejected due to unsustainable costs, poor scalability, and accessibility gaps. AI is necessary to deliver 24/7, instant, cost-effective tax guidance at scale while maintaining accuracy.

**Why RAG-based Generative AI Chosen**:
- **Accuracy**: RAG grounds AI responses in official HMRC guidance, preventing hallucinations
- **Explainability**: Source citations enable citizens to verify guidance (builds trust)
- **Conversational**: Understands natural language questions in any phrasing
- **Scalable**: Handles millions of conversations without proportional cost increase
- **Accessible**: Text-based, works with screen readers, supports Welsh language
- **Updatable**: When tax law changes, update knowledge base (no model retraining)

## Section 3: Decision-Making Process

### 3.1 - Process Integration

**Role in Workflow**:

The ChatBot is a **guidance tool**, not a decision-making system. It does NOT make automated decisions about tax liability, penalties, or eligibility. It provides information to help citizens understand their obligations.

**Process Diagram**:
```
[Citizen Has Tax Question]
  ↓
[Citizen Accesses HMRC ChatBot on GOV.UK]
  ↓
[Citizen Enters Question (text or voice-to-text)]
  ↓
[ChatBot Processes Query]
  ├─ Input Validation (prompt injection detection)
  ├─ RAG Retrieval (find relevant HMRC guidance)
  ├─ LLM Generation (generate response with source citations)
  ├─ Guardrails (validate accuracy, check for harmful content)
  └─ Response to Citizen (with source links)
  ↓
[Citizen Decision Point]
  ├─ If Helpful → Citizen Uses Guidance to Take Action (e.g., file Self Assessment)
  ├─ If Unclear → Citizen Asks Follow-Up Question
  ├─ If Complex → ChatBot Escalates to Human Agent (e.g., "This requires review by tax advisor")
  └─ If Dissatisfied → Citizen Contests via Feedback or Contacts Helpline
  ↓
[Human HMRC Agent Reviews Escalated Cases]
  └─ Provides Personalized Advice or Corrects ChatBot Error
```

**Integration Points**:
1. **GOV.UK Website**: ChatBot embedded as widget on HMRC pages
2. **Government Gateway**: OAuth 2.0 authentication for personalized guidance
3. **HMRC Backend APIs**: Real-time retrieval of citizen tax records (tax code, Self Assessment status) for authenticated users
4. **HMRC Content Management System**: Daily ingestion of updated guidance documents into knowledge base
5. **HMRC ServiceNow**: Escalation of complex queries to human agent queue for callback
6. **HMRC Splunk SIEM**: Real-time streaming of audit logs for security monitoring

**Decision Authority**:
- **ChatBot**: Provides **guidance only** (informational, non-binding)
- **Citizen**: Makes all decisions about tax filing, payments, appeals
- **HMRC Human Agents**: Make decisions on complex cases, appeals, disputes

### 3.2 - Provided Information

**Outputs**:

The ChatBot provides the following information:
1. **Tax Guidance** (natural language response):
   - Explanation of tax concepts (e.g., "Self Assessment is how you report income to HMRC if you're self-employed")
   - Step-by-step instructions (e.g., "To register for Self Assessment: 1. Go to GOV.UK, 2. Click 'Register'...")
   - Deadlines and timelines (e.g., "Self Assessment deadline is 31 January")
   - Eligibility criteria (e.g., "You can claim home office expenses if you work from home regularly")
2. **Source Citations** (clickable links):
   - Link to HMRC guidance document on GOV.UK
   - Legislation reference (e.g., "Finance Act 2023, Section 12")
   - Section/paragraph number for precise verification
3. **Confidence Score** (internal - shown to HMRC staff, not citizens):
   - 0-1 score indicating AI confidence in response
   - <70% confidence triggers disclaimer: "I'm not confident in this answer. Please verify or contact helpline."
4. **Escalation Recommendations**:
   - For complex queries: "This requires personalized review. Call our helpline at 0300 200 3310 or request callback."

**Output Format**:
[X] Generated Content (natural language text)
[X] Recommendation (e.g., "You should register for Self Assessment")
[ ] Score/Rating
[ ] Classification/Category
[ ] Prediction
[ ] Ranking/Prioritization
[ ] Risk Assessment

**Output Interpretation**:
- **Guidance is General**: ChatBot provides general guidance based on HMRC published information. It is NOT personalized tax advice (unless user authenticated and ChatBot retrieves personal tax records).
- **Not Legally Binding**: ChatBot guidance is informational. Citizens are responsible for accurate tax filing. HMRC is not liable for errors unless caused by negligence.
- **Source Citations Required**: Every response MUST cite HMRC sources. If no source cited, guidance is unreliable.
- **Confidence Matters**: Low-confidence responses (<70%) should be verified via helpline or tax advisor.

**Example Response**:
> **User Query**: "What expenses can I claim as a freelance graphic designer?"
>
> **ChatBot Response**:
> "As a freelance graphic designer, you can claim business expenses that are wholly and exclusively for your work. Common allowable expenses include:
> - Office costs (rent, bills, internet)
> - Equipment (computer, software, camera)
> - Travel (client meetings, not commuting to regular workplace)
> - Professional fees (accountant, subscriptions)
>
> You cannot claim personal expenses or anything used partly for personal reasons unless you calculate the business proportion.

[ ] Batch processing
[ ] On-demand

**Escalation Rate Target**: <10% of conversations escalated to human agents (i.e., >90% resolved by ChatBot)

### 3.4 - Human Decisions and Review

**Human Oversight Model**:
[X] Human-on-the-loop (periodic/sample review)
[X] Human-in-command (can override at any time)
[ ] Human-in-the-loop (review EVERY decision before action) - *Not feasible at scale (5M+ conversations/year)*
[ ] Fully automated

**Human Oversight Structure**:

**Tier 1 - Real-Time Escalation**:
- **Trigger**: ChatBot confidence <70%, explicit user request ("I want to speak to a human"), complex scenario (tax calculations, appeals)
- **Process**: ChatBot transfers conversation to HMRC human agent queue (ServiceNow ticketing)
- **Response Time**: <2 working days for callback (authenticated users); helpline number provided (unauthenticated users)
- **Volume**: <10% of conversations (target 500,000 escalations/year in Year 1)

**Tier 2 - Sample Review (Quality Assurance)**:
- **Frequency**: Daily random sample of 100 conversations (0.002% of volume)
- **Reviewers**: HMRC tax policy experts (5 FTE dedicated QA team)
- **Criteria**:
  - Accuracy: Does AI response match HMRC guidance?
  - Source Citations: Are sources correctly cited?
  - Bias: Any evidence of unfair treatment across demographics?
  - Safety: Any harmful or illegal advice?
- **Action**: Errors fed back to improve prompts, guardrails, knowledge base

**Tier 3 - Monthly Accuracy Audit**:
- **Frequency**: Monthly (1000 ground truth queries)
- **Process**: HMRC tax experts manually evaluate AI responses against known correct answers
- **Metric**: >95% accuracy required (thumbs up rate)
- **Action**: If <95%, investigate root cause (knowledge base gap, LLM drift, prompt issues)

**Tier 4 - Quarterly Bias Audit**:
- **Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Process**: Test AI responses across protected characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, disability)
- **Metric**: No statistically significant difference in response quality across groups
- **Action**: If bias detected, investigate training data, prompts, knowledge base for bias; implement mitigations

**Override Capability**:
- **Can humans override**: [X] Yes
- **Who Can Override**:
  - **Citizens**: Can ignore ChatBot advice, call helpline, submit written query
  - **HMRC Agents**: Can correct ChatBot errors, provide different guidance
- **Override Frequency**: <10% (escalation rate target)
- **Override Reasons**: Complex scenario (calculations, appeals), ChatBot error, user preference for human interaction

**Quality Assurance**:
- **Automated Testing**: 1000+ ground truth queries tested daily (regression testing)
- **User Feedback**: "Was this helpful?" thumbs up/down after every response (target >95% thumbs up)
- **Complaint Tracking**: Citizens can report ChatBot errors via feedback form; all complaints reviewed within 5 working days

## Section 6: Fairness, Bias, and Discrimination

### 6.1 - Bias Assessment

**Bias Testing Completed**: [ ] No - **PLANNED** for 2026-04 (before Private Beta)

**Bias Testing Date**: 2026-04 (planned)

**Testing Methodology** (Planned):

**1. Test Dataset Creation**:
- 1,000 ground truth queries covering common tax scenarios
- Queries stratified across demographics:
  - Age: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+
  - Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary
  - Ethnicity: White, Asian, Black, Mixed, Other
  - Disability: Visual impairment, Cognitive disability, None
  - Geography: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland
  - Language: English, Welsh

**2. AI Response Generation**:
- Run all 1,000 queries through ChatBot
- Collect responses, confidence scores, source citations

**3. Human Expert Evaluation**:
- HMRC tax policy experts rate responses (1-5 scale):
  - Accuracy: Does response match HMRC guidance?
  - Helpfulness: Would this help citizen understand tax obligation?
  - Completeness: Are all relevant details included?
  - Clarity: Is response in Plain English?

**4. Statistical Analysis**:
- Compare response quality across demographic groups
- Test for statistically significant differences (p < 0.05)
- Calculate fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds)

**5. Bias Mitigation** (if bias detected):
- Investigate root cause (training data, prompts, knowledge base)
- Implement mitigations (prompt engineering, knowledge base expansion, guardrails)
- Re-test to validate mitigation effectiveness

### 6.2 - Fairness Metrics

**Fairness Metrics Calculated** (Planned for 2026-04):
- [X] Demographic parity (response quality equal across groups)
- [X] Equalized odds (accuracy equal across groups)
- [ ] Equal opportunity
- [ ] Calibration
- [X] Other: User satisfaction parity (thumbs up rate equal across groups)

**Results** (To Be Determined):

| Protected Characteristic | Metric | Result | Threshold | Pass/Fail |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Gender** (Male vs. Female) | Demographic parity (accuracy) | TBD | Difference <5% | TBD |
| **Ethnicity** (White vs. Ethnic minorities) | Demographic parity (accuracy) | TBD | Difference <5% | TBD |
| **Age** (Under 65 vs. 65+) | Demographic parity (accuracy) | TBD | Difference <5% | TBD |
| **Disability** (Disabled vs. Non-disabled) | Demographic parity (accuracy) | TBD | Difference <5% | TBD |

**Threshold Rationale**: <5% difference in accuracy across groups is acceptable (aligns with UK Equality Act 2010 guidance on indirect discrimination)

### 6.3 - Known Limitations and Bias

**Known Limitations** (Pre-Launch):

**1. Language Bias**:
- **Description**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet primarily trained on English text; may have lower performance on Welsh language queries
- **Cause**: Anthropic training data predominantly English
- **Mitigation**:
  - Welsh language knowledge base curated by Welsh-speaking HMRC tax experts
  - User testing with Welsh speakers (Persona 5)
  - Accuracy testing specifically for Welsh queries

**2. Digital Literacy Bias**:
- **Description**: ChatBot assumes basic digital literacy (typing, navigating web interface); may exclude older citizens or those with cognitive disabilities
- **Cause**: Text-based interface requires reading/writing skills
- **Mitigation**:
  - Plain English content (reading age 9 target)
  - Phone helpline remains available (hybrid model)
  - Digital inclusion programs for older citizens
  - Screen reader compatibility for visually impaired

**3. Historical Data Bias**:
- **Description**: If HMRC historical guidance reflects historical gender/ethnic biases (e.g., male-centric tax scenarios), knowledge base may perpetuate these
- **Cause**: HMRC guidance historically written from majority demographic perspective
- **Mitigation**:
  - Knowledge base review by diversity experts (HMRC Equality and Diversity Team)
  - User research with diverse demographics
  - Bias testing (quarterly audits)

**Known Biases** (To Be Confirmed via Testing):
1. [TBD after 2026-04 bias testing]
2. [TBD]
3. [TBD]

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Quarterly bias testing with published results
- User satisfaction tracking by demographics (detect disparities early)
- Contestability (citizens can report biased responses)
- Human oversight (sample review, escalation)

**Residual Risk**:
- Even with mitigations, subtle bias may persist (LLM training data bias beyond HMRC control)
- Ongoing monitoring required to detect and address emerging biases

### 6.4 - Training Data Bias

**Training Data Review**: [X] Partial (HMRC knowledge base reviewed; Claude 3.5 Sonnet training data NOT accessible)

**HMRC Knowledge Base Demographics**:
- **Review Date**: 2025-10
- **Findings**: HMRC guidance documents written in gender-neutral, ethnicity-neutral language (tax law applies equally)
- **Representation**: Coverage includes scenarios for diverse demographics (self-employed, PAYE employees, small businesses, pensioners, disabled, etc.)
- **Gaps**: Limited guidance on non-UK residents, international tax (intentionally out-of-scope)

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet Training Data** (Anthropic Proprietary):
- **HMRC Access**: NONE (Anthropic does not disclose training data)
- **Anthropic Public Statements**: Claude trained on "diverse internet text, books, academic papers" (cutoff April 2024)
- **Known Risks**: Internet text may contain biases (gender, race, age stereotypes)
- **Mitigation**: RAG architecture reduces reliance on LLM parametric memory (responses grounded in HMRC knowledge base, not internet text)

**Known Data Gaps**:
- **Welsh Language**: Limited Welsh training data in Claude 3.5 Sonnet (mitigated via HMRC Welsh knowledge base)
- **Niche Tax Scenarios**: Complex international tax, non-residents (intentionally out-of-scope; escalated to human agents)

**Data Augmentation**:
- HMRC knowledge base intentionally broad (100,000 documents covering common scenarios)
- User feedback loop (citizens flag gaps via thumbs down → HMRC adds guidance)

### 6.5 - Ongoing Bias Monitoring

**Monitoring Frequency**: [X] Quarterly (every 3 months)

**Monitoring Metrics**:
1. **User Satisfaction by Demographics**:
   - Thumbs up rate by age, gender, ethnicity, disability, geography
   - Target: <5% difference across groups
2. **Response Quality by Demographics**:
   - Sample 100 conversations/month per demographic group
   - HMRC experts rate accuracy (1-5 scale)
   - Target: <5% difference in average rating across groups
3. **Escalation Rate by Demographics**:
   - % of conversations escalated to human agents by demographic group
   - Target: <5% difference (higher escalation may indicate lower AI performance for group)

**Alert Thresholds**:
- **Critical Alert** (immediate investigation): >10% difference in thumbs up rate across groups
- **Warning Alert** (next quarterly review): 5-10% difference
- **Acceptable**: <5% difference

**Alert Response**:
1. Investigate root cause (knowledge base gap, prompt bias, LLM drift)
2. Implement mitigation (update knowledge base, adjust prompts, add guardrails)
3. Re-test to validate effectiveness
4. Document in bias monitoring log (published quarterly on GOV.UK)

### 7.3 - Model Versioning and Change Management

**Current Model Version**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)

**Version History** (Planned):

| Version | Date | Changes | Impact |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| **1.0** | 2026-05 | Private Beta launch (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, 100K knowledge base docs) | Initial deployment |
| **1.1** | 2026-07 | Public Beta (knowledge base expanded to 150K docs, Welsh language added) | +50% knowledge base coverage, Welsh support |
| **2.0** | 2026-10 | Production launch (knowledge base 200K docs, fine-tuned prompts) | Full GOV.UK integration |
| **2.1** | 2027-01 | Post-Budget update (2027 tax year changes ingested within 48 hours) | Seasonal update |

**Change Management Process**:

**Minor Changes** (Knowledge Base Updates, Prompt Tweaks):
1. **Proposal**: HMRC Content Team identifies need (e.g., new HMRC guidance published)
2. **Testing**: Update staged in development environment, tested against 1000 ground truth queries
3. **Approval**: HMRC Tax Policy Expert approves (no Architecture Review Board needed)
4. **Deployment**: Automated deployment via CI/CD (no downtime)
5. **Monitoring**: Watch accuracy metrics for 48 hours post-deployment

**Major Changes** (LLM Upgrade, Architecture Change):
1. **Proposal**: Document rationale, impact assessment
2. **Architecture Review**: HMRC Architecture Review Board approval required
3. **Testing**: Extensive testing in staging (10,000 queries, bias testing, security testing)
4. **Private Beta**: Test with 100 citizens before full rollout
5. **Approval**: HMRC SRO approval + CISO approval (security changes)
6. **Deployment**: Blue/green deployment (new version runs in parallel, gradual traffic shift)
7. **Monitoring**: Watch accuracy, bias, latency metrics for 1 week
8. **Rollback**: If issues detected, instant rollback to previous version

**Rollback Capability**: [X] Yes (blue/green deployment allows instant rollback)

### 7.4 - Model Monitoring and Drift Detection

**Drift Monitoring**: [X] Yes (continuous monitoring)

**Monitoring Metrics**:

**1. Data Drift** (Input Distribution Changes):
- **Metric**: Track query topics over time (% Self Assessment vs. PAYE vs. VAT)
- **Expected**: Seasonal variation (Self Assessment peaks in January)
- **Alert**: Unexpected topic shift (e.g., sudden 50% increase in VAT queries → investigate if new policy)
- **Action**: Update knowledge base to reflect changing citizen needs

**2. Concept Drift** (Input-Output Relationship Changes):
- **Metric**: Track AI accuracy over time (% thumbs up, ground truth testing)
- **Expected**: Stable ~95% accuracy
- **Alert**: Accuracy drops below 90% for 7 consecutive days
- **Causes**: Knowledge base outdated (e.g., Budget changes not yet ingested), LLM provider issue (Anthropic model degradation)
- **Action**: Investigate root cause, update knowledge base, escalate to Anthropic if LLM issue

**3. Performance Drift** (Speed/Latency Changes):
- **Metric**: p95 response time
- **Expected**: <2 seconds
- **Alert**: p95 >3 seconds for 1 hour
- **Causes**: AWS infrastructure issue, LLM API slowdown, increased traffic
- **Action**: Auto-scale infrastructure, throttle traffic, escalate to AWS/Anthropic

**Alert Thresholds**:
| Metric | Normal | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Accuracy (thumbs up rate) | >95% | 90-95% | <90% |
| Response time (p95) | <2s | 2-3s | >3s |
| Error rate (5xx) | <0.1% | 0.1-1% | >1% |
| Escalation rate | <10% | 10-15% | >15% |

**Retraining Schedule**:
[X] Triggered by drift detection (if accuracy drops)
[ ] Fixed schedule - *Not applicable for LLMs (cannot retrain Claude)*
[X] Ad-hoc based on performance review (update prompts, knowledge base)

**Note**: HMRC does NOT retrain Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic model, not HMRC-owned). Instead, HMRC updates:
- **System prompts**: Adjust instructions to Claude
- **Knowledge base**: Add/update HMRC guidance documents
- **Guardrails**: Refine content filters

If Claude 3.5 Sonnet itself degrades (Anthropic issue), HMRC can:
- Escalate to Anthropic via AWS Bedrock support
- Switch to alternative LLM (e.g., Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4) if persistent issues

---

## Section 8: Testing and Assurance

### 8.1 - Testing Approach

**Testing Phases**:
- [X] **Unit testing** (individual components): API handlers, RAG retrieval, guardrails, prompt construction (80% code coverage target)
- [X] **Integration testing** (system interaction): End-to-end flow (query → retrieval → LLM → response), Government Gateway auth, HMRC API integration
- [X] **User acceptance testing (UAT)**: Private Beta (100 citizens), Public Beta (10,000 citizens)
- [X] **A/B testing**: Test alternative prompts, knowledge base chunking strategies (optimize accuracy)
- [X] **Shadow testing**: Run ChatBot in parallel with helpline (Month 6-7) to compare accuracy
- [X] **Red teaming** (adversarial testing): Quarterly security testing (prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, toxic outputs)

**Test Coverage**:
- **Code Coverage**: 80% (unit tests)
- **Functional Coverage**: 100% of common tax scenarios (Self Assessment, PAYE, VAT, NI, Capital Gains, Inheritance Tax)
- **Ground Truth Testing**: 1000+ queries with known correct answers (tested monthly)

### 8.2 - Edge Cases and Failure Modes

**Known Edge Cases**:

**1. Ambiguous Queries** (e.g., "What is my deadline?")
- **Handling**: ChatBot asks clarifying question: "Which deadline? Self Assessment (31 Jan), PAYE (varies), or VAT (varies)?"
- **Fallback**: If still ambiguous after 3 turns, escalate to human

**2. Out-of-Scope Queries** (e.g., "How do I evade tax?")
- **Handling**: Guardrails block response, display: "I cannot provide advice on tax evasion. Please contact HMRC for legal guidance."
- **Logging**: Suspicious queries logged to SIEM for security review

**3. Low-Confidence Queries** (complex scenarios, confidence <70%)
- **Handling**: ChatBot displays disclaimer: "I'm not confident in this answer. Please verify with helpline or tax advisor."
- **Escalation**: Offer human callback (authenticated users) or helpline number

**4. API Failures** (Government Gateway down, HMRC APIs unavailable)
- **Handling**: Circuit breaker opens, ChatBot displays: "Personalized guidance temporarily unavailable. Showing general guidance."
- **Fallback**: Cached generic guidance for common queries

**5. Welsh Language Queries with English Knowledge Base Gaps**
- **Handling**: If Welsh guidance unavailable, ChatBot offers: "Mae'n ddrwg gennym, nid yw'r wybodaeth hon ar gael yn Gymraeg eto. A hoffech chi weld y fersiynau Saesneg?" (Sorry, this information not yet available in Welsh. Would you like English version?)

**Failure Modes**:

| Failure Mode | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **LLM returns no result** (API timeout) | Low | Medium (user sees error) | - Retry 3 times with exponential backoff<br>- Timeout after 30s, display: "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again."<br>- Monitor (alert if >1% of requests timeout) |
| **LLM hallucinates** (incorrect guidance) | Medium (without RAG) → Low (with RAG) | High (citizen files incorrectly, incurs penalty) | - RAG grounds responses in HMRC guidance<br>- Source citation (citizen can verify)<br>- Confidence thresholding (<70% flagged)<br>- Ground truth testing (monthly) |
| **Prompt injection attack** | Medium (adversaries will try) | High (harmful advice, PII exposure) | - Input sanitization<br>- AWS Bedrock Guardrails<br>- Rate limiting (500 req/hour/user)<br>- SIEM monitoring<br>- Red teaming (quarterly) |
| **Performance degradation** (p95 latency >2s) | Low | Medium (poor user experience) | - Auto-scaling (add capacity when CPU >70%)<br>- CloudWatch alarms (alert on-call team)<br>- Fallback to cached responses for common queries |
| **Knowledge base outdated** (Budget changes not ingested) | Low | High (incorrect guidance on new tax rules) | - Automated daily ingestion<br>- Real-time ingestion for urgent changes (Budget)<br>- Version control (rollback if bad data ingested) |

**Fallback Procedures**:

**Catastrophic Failure** (Entire ChatBot Down):
1. CloudFront displays maintenance page: "ChatBot temporarily unavailable. Please call our helpline at 0300 200 3310."
2. Helpline agents alerted (expect increased call volume)
3. On-call team paged (PagerDuty)
4. Incident response plan activated (target RTO 15 minutes)

**Partial Failure** (LLM API Down, Knowledge Base Down):
1. Circuit breaker opens (stop calling failed service)
2. Fallback to cached guidance for top 100 common queries
3. Display disclaimer: "Limited functionality. For complex queries, please call helpline."
4. Monitor and alert (escalate to AWS/Anthropic if persistent)

- **Improved Accessibility**: 24/7 availability, WCAG 2.2 AA, Welsh language → Evidence: User research with disabled citizens, Welsh speakers
- **Reduced Wait Times**: <2s vs. 10-20 min → Evidence: CloudWatch latency metrics vs. helpline call center analytics

### 12.2 - User Feedback

**User Research Conducted**: [X] Yes (Discovery phase completed 2025-10)

**Discovery Phase Findings** (2025-10):
- **Sample**: 50 citizens (diverse age, gender, ethnicity, disability, geography)
- **Method**: User interviews, usability testing (prototype ChatBot)
- **Key Findings**:
  - 85% of citizens support 24/7 self-service for simple tax queries
  - 60% struggle to find relevant guidance via GOV.UK keyword search
  - 75% found rule-based chatbots frustrating ("doesn't understand my question")
  - **Concerns**: 40% worried AI might give incorrect advice → Mitigated via source citations, human escalation
  - **Accessibility**: Screen reader users (JAWS) could navigate prototype successfully with ARIA labels

**User Satisfaction** (Post-Launch):
- **Target**: >70 NPS
- **Current**: TBD (measured monthly via in-app survey)

**User Concerns** (Anticipated Pre-Launch):
- **Concern 1: "Can I trust AI?"**
  - **Response**: Every response cites official HMRC sources (clickable links to GOV.UK). You can verify guidance yourself.
- **Concern 2: "What if AI gives wrong advice?"**
  - **Response**: We test AI accuracy monthly (>95% target). If you think advice is incorrect, click "This is wrong" and a human will review.
- **Concern 3: "Is my data safe?"**
  - **Response**: Your data is encrypted and stored in UK only. We comply with UK GDPR. You can request deletion anytime.

**Feedback Mechanism**:
- **In-App Feedback**: "Was this helpful?" (thumbs up/down) after every response
- **Feedback Form**: "Report an issue" button (what was wrong? incorrect, biased, unhelpful, other)
- **Helpline**: Citizens can call 0300 200 3310 to report concerns
- **Formal Complaint**: HMRC complaints procedure (online form, 28-day response SLA)
